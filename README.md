PROJECT UNDER DEVELOPMENT  
NOT EVEN IN AN ALPHA VERSION NOW :)

## How to contribute ?

This extension project is now under developement. Contributions are still difficult for the moment. However, you will be able to contribute soon !
- By translating texts other than in English and French,
- By creating issues, and even fixing them :)

## How it works ?

TODO

## For developers : how to set up the project ?

### Todoist Account

In order to make this project working and testable, you will need to own a [Todoist Account](https://todoist.com).  
You will also need to declare an application in [Todoist Application Management](https://developer.todoist.com/appconsole.html), in order to get Client Id and Secret values which will have to be set in the following credentials files. 

### Credentials

For security reasons, Todoist API credentials are not committed to the Git repository.  
For the moment, a very basic solution is used : credentials are externalized into files which are Git-ignored.  
A better solution will be found as soon as possible.

If you download this source code, to make the Browser Extension working, you have to create a `credentials.js` file in `BrowserExtension` directory. This file must look like:  
> const CLIENT_ID = "12345";
> const TEMP_TOKEN = "123456";

where:
- `CLIENT_ID` value is replaced by your Todoist Application Client ID
- `TEMP_TOKEN` value is replaced by a valid token : your own [Todoist API Key](https://todoist.com/prefs/integrations), or a true token generated through the authorization flow (currently manually got from the ProxyAPI).

Moreover, to make the ProxyAPI works, you have to create a `credentials.properties` file in `TodoistProxyAPI/src/main/resources` directory. This file must look like:
> CLIENT_ID=123456
> CLIENT_SECRET=123456
> TEMP_CODE=123456
> TEMP_TOKEN=123465

where:
- `CLIENT_ID` has the same value as in `credentials.js` file
- `CLIENT_SECRET` value is the Secret Key got from your [Todoist Application Management](https://developer.todoist.com/appconsole.html)
- `TEMP_CODE` is the code generated by the Browser Extension during Authentication Flow and manually got in the browser console (while the Proxy API is not really deployed). It allows to get a true token got from Todoist API, which can be used in `credentials.js` file, while the `Todoist Proxy API` integration is not done in Browser Extension. 
- `TEMP_TOKEN` is the token got from the previous-line-process, you want to revoke.
